# Technologies Used
- **Front-end**: Developed in React, an open-source JavaScript library known for its efficiency and scalability in UI development.

- **Programming Language**: Was used TypeScript, a language that adds static typing to JavaScript, providing greater security and productivity to the code.

- **Styling**: The whol interface is crafted with Styled-Components, a library that allows component styling with the flexibility of CSS-in-JS.

## Backend

The project's API was developed by a team of former students from the course. They are awesome, by the way.
