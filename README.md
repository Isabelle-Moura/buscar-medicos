The application encompasses a range of features, including a login system and six main screens: Dashboard, Registered Users, Plans, Specialties, Notifications, and FAQ.

### Login Screen

The login screen allows users to authenticate themselves within the application. Upon successful login, users are directed to the main dashboard.

### Dashboard

In this screen, users can:

- View the last 3 users registered in the API.
- Check the number of doctors and service providers on the platform.
- Determine how many doctors and service providers are available or unavailable.

In this screen, users can:

- View all existing users in the API.
- Categorize users into doctors and service providers.
- Click on a name in the table to access the complete user details.

- Review available plans, including the period, status (active or inactive), and cost.
- Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage plans.

## Technologies Used
- **Front-end**: Developed in React, an open-source JavaScript library widely recognized for its efficiency and scalability in user interface development.

- **Programming Language**: We use TypeScript, a language that adds static typing to JavaScript, providing greater security and productivity to the code.

- **Styling**: The attractive and responsive interface is crafted with Styled-Components, a library that allows component styling with the flexibility of CSS-in-JS.

### Backend

The project's API was developed by a team of former students from the course.
